## Description

A local library wants to digitize its operations to improve efficiency and
provide a better user experience. Your task is to design and implement a
simplified version of a Library Management System (LMS). The system should allow
for managing books, patrons (library members), and the borrowing process.

**DISCLAIMER**: This requirement was generated by ChatGPT, and purpose is purely
education and recreational. This is no way a standard or "great code", so if you
learn from this, its upto the reader.

## Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

1. **Book Management**:

- Add new books to the library catalog.
- Update information about a book.
- Delete a book from the catalog.
- Search for books by title, author, or subject.

2. **Patron Management**:

- Add new patrons to the system.
- Update patron information.
- Delete a patron record.
- Search for patrons by name or ID.

3. **Borrowing**:

- Check out a book to a patron (assuming the book is available).
- Return a book to the library.
- Extend the borrowing period.
- Keep track of overdue books and fines. (Fines are calculated based on the
  number of days a book is overdue. Assume a fixed rate per day.)

4. **System Constraints and Considerations**:

- A patron can borrow a maximum of 5 books at a time.
- The borrowing period is 2 weeks, with the option to extend once for another 2
  weeks.
- Books and patrons should be uniquely identifiable.

5. **Reporting (Bonus)**:

- Generate a report of all books currently borrowed.
- Generate a report of overdue books and the respective fines.

#### Deliverables

1. **Class Diagrams and LLD**:

- Draw a class diagram showing the design of your system.
- Include any interfaces or abstract classes you think are necessary.
- Clearly define the relationships between classes.

2. **Code**:

- Implement your design in Java, Python, C++, or any language of your choice.
- Your code should be clean, modular, and follow good coding practices.
- Ensure your code is well-commented and easy to read.

3. **Testing**:

- Write unit tests for your code covering key functionalities.
- Demonstrate how your system handles edge cases.

4. **Documentation**:

- Provide a README file that includes:
- Instructions on how to set up and run your system.
- A brief explanation of your design choices and how they address the system
  requirements.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- **Design**: Clarity, extensibility, and scalability of the class design and
  system architecture.
- **Code** Quality: Readability, use of design patterns, and adherence to coding
  standards.
- **Correctness**: The system should work as described in the requirements.
- **Testing**: Coverage and thoroughness of unit tests.

#### Integration Test

- [sample input_file](./TODO)

```console
add_book "The Great Gatsby" "F. Scott Fitzgerald" "Novel"
add_book "To Kill a Mockingbird" "Harper Lee" "Novel"
add_patron "Jane Doe"
add_patron "John Smith"
checkout_book "Jane Doe" "The Great Gatsby"
checkout_book "John Smith" "To Kill a Mockingbird"
return_book "Jane Doe" "The Great Gatsby"
list_currently_checked_out_books
add_book "1984" "George Orwell" "Novel"
checkout_book "Jane Doe" "1984"
report_overdue_books
```

- [sample output_file](./TODO)

```console
add_book "The Great Gatsby" "F. Scott Fitzgerald" "Novel"
add_book "To Kill a Mockingbird" "Harper Lee" "Novel"
add_patron "Jane Doe"
add_patron "John Smith"
checkout_book "Jane Doe" "The Great Gatsby"
checkout_book "John Smith" "To Kill a Mockingbird"
return_book "Jane Doe" "The Great Gatsby"
list_currently_checked_out_books
add_book "1984" "George Orwell" "Novel"
checkout_book "Jane Doe" "1984"
report_overdue_books
```

**NOTE**:This example covers basic functionalities and provides a structure for
testing. It includes adding items to the system, interacting with those items,
and viewing reports or statuses. You can expand upon this with more detailed
scenarios, such as handling overdue books, generating fines, extending checkout
periods, and more complex queries to fully test the system's capabilities.
